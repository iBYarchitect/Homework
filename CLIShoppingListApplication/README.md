# ShoppingList Application

This is the application for macOS to work in CLI where you can store list of shopping, add and remove items, and view your current shopping list.

## Usage

The application allows the user to enter commands and execute actions. After launching the app, the user is prompted to input a command, which the app processes and displays the result. The app then prompts the user for the next command and the process repeats until the user decides to exit the application.

## Features

- User-friendly CLI interface: The app should have a clean and easy-to-use command-line interface that allows users to navigate and interact with the program easily.
- Command prompt: The app should display a proper prompt to indicate to users that the program is waiting for a command.
- Command processing: The app should process user commands and provide appropriate feedback based on the actions performed.
- List display: The app should be able to show users a list of items in the grocery list.
- Item addition: The app should allow users to add items to the grocery list, subject to a maximum limit of 10 items.
- Item removal: The app should allow users to remove items from the grocery list.
- Error handling: The app should display an error message if the user tries to add more than 10 items to the list or attempts to add a duplicate item to the list.

## Roadmap

- Add functionality for the next commands help, add, remove, and show items from current shopping list and tests for non-private methods.
