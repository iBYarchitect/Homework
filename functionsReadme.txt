Hi Dersim!

Can you check my functions homework?

This is my first programming homework.
I created 4 functions with same structure for choosing min/max integers, also I wrote 4 functions with same structures for searching min/max different data types(Int, Double)

When I'd written this functions I was found information in documentation, that we have min() Instance Method, is it correct to use it in this task?
